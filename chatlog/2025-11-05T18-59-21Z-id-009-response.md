Full Response:
Executing instructions: 1) Applied chatlog protocol (new entry ID 9: added row to index.md, created full response file, appended transcript). 2) Preparing prompt branch per branching strategy with slug execute-chatlog-and-branching. Next steps: create branch, commit changes referencing Prompt ID 009, push, and (optionally) open PR. Hash remains HASH_PENDING. Corrections would reuse ID 9. CI should pass integrity since only chatlog changed.
