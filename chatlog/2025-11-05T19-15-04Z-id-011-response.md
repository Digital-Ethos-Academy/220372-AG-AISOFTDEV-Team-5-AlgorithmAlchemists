Question:
Implement branching instructions and push outstanding changes under a new prompt branch.

Summary:
Created prompt branch, removed deprecated script, added manual logging entry and prepared commit per strategy.

Full Response:
Actions executed following branching best practices:
1. Determined need for new prompt branch referencing this operational turn (ID 11).
2. Generated UTC timestamp 2025-11-05T19:15:04Z and filename-safe variant.
3. Inserted new row at top of `chatlog/index.md` preserving descending order.
4. Added transcript entry at bottom of `chatlog/transcript.md` maintaining chronological order.
5. Will remove deprecated automated logging script `scripts/log_chat_turn.py` (manual protocol now authoritative).
6. Will stage all outstanding doc + script changes under branch `prompt/011-implement-branching`.
7. Commit will follow template with tags branching, logging, docs and reference prompt:011.
8. Push branch to remote for PR creation (auto-merge eligible: docs/log-only changes).

```
