Question:
Implement code review corrections (master vs main, manual logging consistency) and push to new branch.

Summary:
Implemented review fixes: switched master→main, clarified manual logging (index.md + index.json), standardized correction steps.

Full Response:
Applied code review recommendations:
1. Replaced all remaining instances of 'master' with 'main' in branching strategy.
2. Clarified manual logging workflow to explicitly include JSON mirror updates (README, PRD, instructions).
3. Added lifecycle & ordering rule for `index.json` (newest first) plus atomicity requirements.
4. Documented correction protocol to update both markdown surfaces and JSON mirror.
5. Logged this governance change as ID 12.
