Question:
Use all attached files for context. Execute the instructions in #file:chatlog_instructions.md in order to update the chatlog. Do all the work yourself and remove the script that is supposed to do it, we will no longer utilize the script. Proceed. (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

Summary:
Logged turn manually per protocol; added entry ID 10 and deprecated logging script removed for future manual maintenance.

Full Response:
Executed chat logging protocol manually without the helper script. Actions performed:
1. Determined next ID (10) since index already contained up to ID 9.
2. Generated a UTC ISO8601 timestamp (2025-11-05T19:03:07Z) and filename-safe variant.
3. Inserted new row directly beneath the table header in `chatlog/index.md` (descending order preserved) with:
   - Truncated question (≤160 chars) version for the table.
   - One-sentence abstract summary ending with a period (≤200 chars).
   - Tags: logging,cleanup.
   - Hash placeholder: HASH_PENDING.
4. Created this full response file using the required template fields.
5. Appended transcript entry at the bottom of `chatlog/transcript.md` referencing the new filename.
6. Deleted `scripts/log_chat_turn.py` to enforce manual maintenance going forward.

Protocol Conformance Checks:
- ID sequencing: 1→10 without gaps (prior ID 9 retained).
- Timestamp format matches regex and filename uses hyphen substitutions.
- Summary length well under 200 chars and ends with a period.
- Tags lowercase, comma-separated, within allowed conceptual set.
- Hash field retained as HASH_PENDING (no hashing routine active).
- Atomicity: All three surfaces updated in one operation; script file removed.

Next Manual Logging Guidance:
To log future turns, replicate the same steps manually:
1. Read `chatlog/index.md` for highest ID.
2. Prepare summary (≤200 chars) and tags.
3. Add new row beneath header with new ID.
4. Create `YYYY-MM-DDThh-mm-ssZ-id-XXX-response.md` file.
5. Append entry to `chatlog/transcript.md`.
6. Keep hash as HASH_PENDING until hashing mechanism introduced.
